Description:
A GUI for [xensik's](https://github.com/xensik) [gsc-tool](https://github.com/xensik/gsc-tool), of course.

Features:
- Obviously supports every game gsc-tool does.
- Keyboard shortcut: select a script on the GUI and work on it in your development environment of choice. When you want to compile, just hit WinKey+C.
- Automatically copy the compiled script to your Plutonium folder for testing.
- Easily compile .gsc files from other folders, great if you want a separate folder for prototyping your scripts.
- Save your selected folder, game, and auto-copy preference to registry so the app will remember next time you launch it.
